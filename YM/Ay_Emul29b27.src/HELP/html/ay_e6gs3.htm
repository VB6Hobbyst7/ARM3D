<P><B><I>Tab sheet Track descriptor.</I></B></P>

<P>You can adjust feature “Ay_Emul Track Descriptor” for saving current Ay_Emul status in text file. Good tradition exists among FIDO users. They like to design their letters and conference messages with some original texts. Many message editors allow adding text from file automatically. So, you can insert cool strings of text into your letters (for example, as signature). One of these strings can be Ay_Emul status string. What you need that simply adjust Ay_Emul and your post program:</P>

<P><I>File Name</I> – file name with path of text file for storing Ay_Emul current status.</P>

<P><I>Prefix </I>– piece of text, which will be placed at the beginning of status string.</P>

<P><I>Suffix</I> – text, which will be placed at the end of status string, in case of Ay_Emul is playing now.</P>

<P><I>Nothing </I>– text, which will be placed after the <I>Prefix</I>, in case of Ay_Emul is silent now.</P>

<P><I>Enabled </I>– turn on the feature.</P>

<P><I>Kill on exit</I> – if checked, then file will be erased after closing Ay_Emul.</P>

<P><I>Kill on nothing</I> – if checked, then file will be erased each time, when Ay_Emul is not playing.</P>

<P><I>Windows encoding</I> – if checked, then text will be saved in Windows encoding, otherwise in MS-DOS one.</P>

<P>If you are using mail client The Bat!, then for adding string into your letter make next.</P>

<P>1. Open “Account Properties” dialog (Account-&gt;Properties…).</P>

<P>2. Click on “+” near of “Templates” option.</P>

<P>3. Chose needed template (for example, “New message”).</P>

<P>4. Somewhere in template text (usually at the end) add next string:</P>

<P>%PUT="C:\Ay_Emul\AYSTATUS.TXT"</P>

<P>where in quotes type same string as in <I>File Name </I>field of “FIDO Tools” dialog.</P>

<P>5. Insert this string into other templates, if you want.</P>

<P>Fidolook Express 2001 (plug-in for Outlook Express) can be adjusted too. Press “Templates” button and choose page “New Post”. In field “Signature” add string</P>

<P>%file(c:\Ay_Emul\AYSTATUS.TXT).</P>

<P>If you want, add the string into other templates. Both described programs are for Windows, so check option <I>Windows encoding</I> of “FIDO Tools” dialog. Fidolook SL can be adjusted in same way.</P>

<P>String format:</P>

<P><I>&lt;Prefix&gt;&lt;String “Author-Title” from main window&gt;&lt;Suffix&gt;</I></P>

<P>if Ay_Emul is playing something, otherwise</P>

<P><I>&lt;Prefix&gt;&lt;Nothing&gt;</I></P>

<P><B>Uninstall</B> button allows remove both emulators settings and files associations from system registry. Use it before deleting Ay_Emul from system.</P>

<P><B>Close</B> button is used for closing "Tools" box.</P>

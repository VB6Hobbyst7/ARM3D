<P>Emulator can try to recognize file type during opening. If file has standard extension (VTX, STC, etc) then Emulator doesn't do additional checks (in the most cases). If file has non-standard extension ($m, $c, TRD, SNA, etc) then Emulator tries to recognize type by header analyzing. And if header analyzing cannot recognize file type, then Emulator searches for tunes in this file. If this process is long then you may push "Cancel" button of the popup dialog box. All found files could be saved from Playlist window by popup menu item <I>Save as…</I> Emulator tries to extract additional information about module from TRD, SCL and Hobeta headers.</P>

<P>Four AY_Emul windows can be active at one time: main, playlist, mixer and tools. You can switch between these windows by mouse or from keyboard: ALT+F6 is switching between last two active windows; ALT+SHIFT+F6 is cyclical switching among all opened windows (only when icon on tray). By the way, you can play music and switch windows even during work of “Search for tools in files” tool.</P>

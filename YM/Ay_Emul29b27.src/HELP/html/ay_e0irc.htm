<H1><A NAME="vtx"></A>VTX</H1>

<P>Roman Scherbakov (V_Soft) designed this type. This is the best format for storing interrupted music from different AY-3-8910/12 and YM2149 based platforms.</P>

00 dec  2 bytes Word     VTX file identifier (ay or ym)
                         Its chip type by default:
                         this is 7961h or 31073 dec (ay)
                         this is 6D79h or 28025 dec (ym)
02      1                Byte bit               Playing mode by default:
                         Bits 0-2 determine stereo mode:

03      2       Word     Loop VBL number (from zero =
                         beginning of melody).
05      4       Dword    AY chip frequency for this melody
                         ( for compatibility with non-Spectrum platforms)
                         Standard values:
                         ZX_Spectrum: 1773400 (or 001B0F58h)
                         Atari: 2000000 (or 001E8480h)

09      1       Byte     Player frequency (VBL per sec).
                         Standard value 50 =
                         1/50 sec (20ms).
10      2 bytes Word     Year of composition creating.
12      4       Dword    Size of not packed data.
                         Needed for unpacking.
16      1-255   NTString String with melody name
                         (1-254 chars), must be ended with zero even
                         if no title at all!
??      1-255   NTString String with author name (see ^)
??      1-255   NTString Melody source program (see ^)
??      1-255   NTString Musical editor name (see ^)
??      1-255   NTString Comment string (see ^)

<P><B>Remarks.</B></P>

<P>1) Data compressed with LHA type 5. May to pack with LHA.EXE (as YM files), but needed to cut header and last zero byte of compressed file. Header of LHA-archive file is found at start of file. Its length is value of first byte of header plus 2.</P>

<P>2) After unpacking the data block is equivalent to YM3 data block.</P>

<P>Also can be found old version of VTX files (of VTX player older than 2.00 version). AY Emulator can to play it too.</P>

<P>VTX files can be converted from emulators sound dump files (for ZX Spectrum and MSX this is usually PSG-files). But last time you can find emulators, which can to dump music in VTX format too. One of them is Unreal Speccy by SMT.</P>

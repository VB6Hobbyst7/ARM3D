<H1><A NAME="commandline"></A>Command line</H1>

<P>Emulator can take parameters from command line. Parameters must be divided with spaces. If parameters are starts with '/' (slash line) then they are interprets as keys else as files names. If file name contains spaces, it must be quoted. If any other key contains spaces then it must be quoted too. You can quote only part of key containing spaces. Files in command line will be added to cleared playlist and will start playing. You can give in command line one or more file names (including playlist files: M3U and AYL). You can specify track/song number for multitrack/multisong files (AY, AYM, MID or XMI) after filename (using “:N” addition, where N is track number starting from 0). List of available keys here.</P>

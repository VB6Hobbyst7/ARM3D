<H1><A NAME="intconv"></A>How to interrupt converting</H1>

<P>During converting, main window is becoming active and progress slider shows current progress of converting process. In most cases you can simply wait for end of converting (when slider will come to max right position and stops). But if you want, you can stop process at any time by pressing <I>Escape</I> button or by clicking on main window by left mouse button. This behavior of emulator is coming from first version. You can use any partially converted file as ordinary one.</P>

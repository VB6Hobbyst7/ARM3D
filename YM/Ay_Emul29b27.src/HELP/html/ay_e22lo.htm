<H1><A NAME="startingemul"></A>Starting time of Emulator</H1>

<P>During starting Emulator sets all of its parameters to values, was previously saved to system register.</P>

<P>Emulator does not allow starting second instance of it. It simply redirects all command line parameters to first instance Emulator. So, you can change emulator settings from command line during playing even.</P>

<P>And one more. After starting Emulator searches for file Ay_Emul.ayl in folder with Ay_Emul.exe and load it into "Playlist" window. After closing Emulator automatically saves current playlist to Ay_Emul.ayl.</P>

<P>So, if you have problems during starting Ay_Emul, you can remove from registry HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Sergey Vladimirovich Bulba\ZX Spectrum Sound Chip Emulator or Ay_Emul.ayl before bug-reporting.</P>

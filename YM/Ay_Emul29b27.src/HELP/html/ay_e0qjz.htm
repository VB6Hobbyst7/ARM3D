<P>Emulator supports playlist files of Winamp (M3U) and of own format (AYL). AYL can contain full info about each item.</P>

<P>Emulator can be used as powerful tool for working with AY/YM data files. Built-in Speccy music ripper can to find modules of many ZX Spectrum musical editors in any source data. Emulator can convert modules to WAV, ZXAY, VTX, YM6 or PSG formats. Emulator can play digital sound is stored in OUT, ZXAY, EPSG, AY or AYM files. Beeper music in AY and AYM formats are supported too. Emulator can play all special effects are used by Atari ST musicians and stored in YM2, YM5 and YM6 formats.</P>

<P>Skin-files can change view of emulator main window.</P>

<P>BASS.DLL library is loaded only before playing corresponding file and unloaded immediately after stopping playing.</P>

<P>System requirements: Windows 95 or compatible; for work processor 386 or greater is required; for playing sound card with support of 8 or 16 bit Stereo or Mono digital sound at any sample frequency in range from 8000 to 300000 Hz and high performance processor (Pentium 133 is tested). Some beeper music in AY and AYM files require Pentium 166 MHz and higher. By default emulator uses special filter which requires more powerful processor, but it gives more quality sound chip and beeper emulation. For playing extra file types of BASS.DLL require DirectX 3 or above, for MOD music additionally processor with MMX is required.</P>

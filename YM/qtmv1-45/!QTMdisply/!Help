QTMDisplay v0.65b (c) Stephen Harrison 2013

Christmas 2013 - FIRST RELEASE


Welcome to QTMDisplay, a full 4/6/8 channel tracker-style display for QTM.

Based on the layout of the 1990's Amiga tracker programme 'ProTracker 2.3D',
this tracker display shows the music patterns in real time, as the track
plays in QTM, along with 8-channel sample scopes, VU bars and additional
track information. Also a selection of control buttons are provided, just
click to use: Play/Pause/Stop/FF/RW and EXIT.

The base (4 channel) outline code for this was actually written back in 1997,
as part of the never-finished QTMEditor and has laid dormant on my old Risc
PC HDD until only a few months ago. The code has now been updated and
improved to work with the latest QTM v1.45, supporting 4/6/8 channel tracks
and run full speed (50+ fps) on all versions of RISC OS from 3.1 to the
latest 32bit RISC OS 5.21.

This is easy to use: Just load QTMv1.45, load some music, then run
QTMDisplay!


32bit colour...

Owners of Raspberry Pis will see QTMDisplay with improved full 32bit colour
display by default. When run on other modern RISC OS hardware, an option for
full colour will appear briefly on loading - just answer 'Y' to use full
colour. Note: RiscPCs will also see this option, and can display the full
colour version, although not even a StrongArm RiscPC is fast enough to keep
up with the memory bandwidth required, so the display will be slightly jerky.


Enjoy!

!Help file for !MiniVuBrs 0.21 ('Probably the smallest VU Bars in the World')
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This program, along with all its files are © 1993 Phoenix (of QUANTUM)

  The purpose of this short program is to put a set of rather nice VU Bars
on your icon bar - to keep you interested while you are listening to any
computerised music/samples. You may ask "what is a VU Bar?" VU=Volume Unit.

  This program has been tested on a load of different computers, from 1Mb to
4Mb, Risc OS2/3 - so it should work on your one. If it doesn't work, or you
find any bugs, send me details of your computer, and what went wrong. If you
send a disc, then I might be able to find some other bits of P.D. to send
back - I will reply to EVERY letter, as long as you send a stamped,
addressed envelope...

  History (...is boring!!!)

  If you are interested in high quality music coming out of your computer,
then look out for my very own Sound Tracker playing module, which shall
hopefully be able to play EVERY effect that Amiga sound trackers can, at a
very high quality sample rate. This should be appearing with your local P.D.
supplier, as soon as I have finished it...

  Get QUANTUM's 'New Dawn', the best disc magazine for the Arc - available
from DataFile P.D.

  Look out for other QUANTUM stuff & my other P.D. bits and pieces.


  P.S. Hello to Leon, Gary, Tim, Ben Carter + everyone (else) in QUANTUM!!!

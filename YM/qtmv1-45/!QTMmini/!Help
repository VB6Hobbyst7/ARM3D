Welcome to QTheMusic (QTM), the ProTracker / StarTrekker player for Risc OS.

!QTMmini is a very small application, which loads and controls the QTMTracker
module. Once loaded, !QTMmini displays an icon on the iconbar which moves in
time to any music currently being played by QTM.

To pause the music playing, left-click once on the QTMmini icon, then click
again to start music playing. To stop and rewind the music to the start,
right-click on the QTMmini icon then click again to start playing.

This 'mini-app' is part of the QTM v1.43 full source code release, but may be
distributed separately so long as this !Help file remains inside it. !QTMmini
was written in 1993, but never officially released until now.

For more details about QTM and to download the QTM v1.43 source code release
pack, visit the QTM web page at: www.phlamethrower.co.uk/riscos/qtm.php
